## Objective

To compare wild type versus very long-chain acylCoA dehydrogenase knockout mice on the following experimental conditions

A. Rest versus exhaustive exercise  
B. MCT chow versus experimental chow with triheptanoin  

The design of both experiments is a two-factor balanced design with multiple measurements (300 metabolites per mouse). 
The primary challenge of the analysis will be to reduce the data (using principle components analysis or other data reduction techniques) or to account for the correlation structure of the multiple measurements.


## Deliverables

1. Analysis of experiment A
  * Standardize measurements
  * Perform data reduction and model reduced data
  * Model non-reduced data accounting for within-mouse correlation structure
  * Compare models
  * Summarize
2. Analysis of experiment B
  * Same as above
3. Text describing the statistical methods used, suitable for a manuscript
